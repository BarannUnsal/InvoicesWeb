# Invoice Web Application

Greetings for Everyone
The project I am preparing to reinforce the topics I have learned.
It is developed with n-Layer design pattern and .Net Core 5.

What I've used so far:

- Generic Repository Pattern
- CQRS Pattern
- Entity FrameWork Core
- I pay attention to the principles of SOLID
- Microsoft Azure Service
- JWT Bearer

This project, which I am doing to improve myself, is the systems I is a work I do to integrate design patterns and reinforce my learning process.
